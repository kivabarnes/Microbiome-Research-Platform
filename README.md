# Microbiome Token and Marketplace

## Overview

The Microbiome Token and Marketplace is a blockchain-based platform that enables the creation and exchange of microbiome-related products using a custom fungible token on the Stacks blockchain.

## Key Features

### Microbiome Token Contract
- Custom fungible token creation
- Owner-only minting
- Token URI management
- Balance tracking
- Token transfer functionality

### Microbiome Marketplace Contract
- Product listing
- Product updates
- Product purchase mechanism
- Seller-controlled product management

## Smart Contracts

### Microbiome Token Contract

#### Key Functions
- `mint`: Create new tokens (owner-only)
- `transfer`: Move tokens between accounts
- `get-balance`: Check token balance
- `get-token-uri`: Retrieve token metadata URI
- `set-token-uri`: Update token metadata URI

#### Error Handling
